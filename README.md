# 🍵 Matcha

An agent-native voice-and-vision framework. Turn any audio/visual device -- earbuds, smart glasses, pendants, phones -- into an always-on AI companion that can perceive, understand, and act on your behalf.

Built by [Intentlabs](https://github.com/Intent-Lab).

**Supported platforms:** iOS (iPhone) and Android

---

## The Problem

Today's voice AI apps (ChatGPT Voice, Gemini Live, Sesame) are **conversational but not agentic**. They can talk to you, but they cannot act for you. When they try to do complex tasks (search, multi-step workflows, API calls), they go silent for 10-30 seconds -- broken UX.

Meanwhile, agent frameworks (OpenClaw, Manus, Claude Code) can execute complex tasks but have no real-time voice interface.

**No consumer product today combines real-time voice conversation with general-purpose agent execution.** Matcha fills this gap.

---

## Core Architecture: Dual-Agent System

Matcha separates real-time voice interaction from asynchronous task execution, allowing both to run simultaneously without blocking each other.

**Voice Agent** -- maintains real-time bidirectional audio with the user. Sub-second latency. Never blocked by tasks. Powered by Gemini Live API or OpenAI Realtime API.

**Action Agent** -- receives task delegations from Voice Agent. Executes complex, multi-step tasks in the background via [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw) (56+ skills: web search, messaging, smart home, notes, reminders, etc.). Reports results back to Voice Agent when ready.

**Example flow:**
1. User: "Find me the best ramen places in SF that are open late"
2. Voice Agent: "Sure, let me search for late-night ramen spots."
3. Action Agent begins web search in background
4. User: "Oh also, I want somewhere with vegetarian options"
5. Voice Agent: "Got it, I'll filter for vegetarian-friendly places too."
6. Action Agent returns results
7. Voice Agent speaks the answer conversationally

The user is never left in silence. The agent is never limited to shallow answers.

## Setup: OpenClaw (Optional)

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw) gives Matcha the ability to take real-world actions: send messages, search the web, manage lists, control smart home devices, and more. Without it, the AI is voice + vision only (no task execution).

### 1. Install and configure OpenClaw

Follow the [OpenClaw setup guide](https://github.com/nichochar/openclaw). Make sure the gateway is enabled:

In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "bind": "lan",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "your-gateway-token-here"
    },
    "http": {
      "endpoints": {
        "chatCompletions": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Configure the app

**iOS** -- In `Secrets.swift`:
```swift
static let openClawHost = "http://Your-Mac.local"
static let openClawPort = 18789
static let openClawGatewayToken = "your-gateway-token-here"
```

**Android** -- In `Secrets.kt`:
```kotlin
const val openClawHost = "http://Your-Mac.local"
const val openClawPort = 18789
const val openClawGatewayToken = "your-gateway-token-here"
```

Both iOS and Android also have an in-app Settings screen where you can change these values at runtime.

### 3. Start the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Audio Pipeline

- **Input**: Mic -> AudioManager (PCM Int16, 16kHz mono, 100ms chunks) -> Voice Model WebSocket
- **Output**: Voice Model WebSocket -> AudioManager playback queue -> Speaker
- **Echo cancellation**: Aggressive AEC (`voiceChat`) when speaker is on phone; mild AEC (`videoChat`) when using glasses
- **Mic muting**: Automatically mutes mic while AI speaks when speaker + mic are co-located

### Tool Calling (Dual-Agent Flow)

1. User says "Add eggs to my shopping list"
2. Voice Agent acknowledges: "Sure, adding that now"
3. Voice Agent delegates `AgentTask` to Action Agent via `AgentCoordinator`
4. Action Agent sends HTTP POST to OpenClaw gateway
5. OpenClaw executes the task
6. Action Agent returns `AgentResult` to coordinator
7. Coordinator delivers result back to Voice Agent
8. Voice Agent speaks the confirmation

The Voice Agent remains responsive throughout -- the user can continue talking while tasks execute.

---

## Requirements

### iOS
- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Gemini API key ([get one free](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
- Meta Ray-Ban glasses (optional -- use iPhone mode for testing)
- OpenClaw on your Mac (optional -- for task execution)

### Android
- Android 14+ (API 34+)
- Android Studio Ladybug or newer
- GitHub account with `read:packages` token (for DAT SDK)
- Gemini API key ([get one free](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
- Meta Ray-Ban glasses (optional -- use Phone mode for testing)
- OpenClaw on your Mac (optional -- for task execution)

---

## Troubleshooting

**AI doesn't hear me** -- Check that microphone permission is granted. Speak clearly and at normal volume.

**OpenClaw connection timeout** -- Make sure your phone and Mac are on the same Wi-Fi network, the gateway is running (`openclaw gateway restart`), and the hostname matches your Mac's Bonjour name.

**"Gemini API key not configured"** -- Add your API key in Secrets.swift/Secrets.kt or in the in-app Settings.

**Echo/feedback in iPhone mode** -- The app mutes the mic while the AI is speaking. If you still hear echo, try turning down the volume.

**Android: Gradle sync fails with 401** -- Your GitHub token is missing or doesn't have `read:packages` scope. Check `local.properties`. Generate a new token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

For DAT SDK issues, see the [developer documentation](https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop/) or the [discussions forum](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios/discussions).
